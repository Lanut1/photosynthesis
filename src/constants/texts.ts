  TITLE: 'Photosynthesis',
  INTRO: {
    DEFINITION: 'Photosynthesis is how plants live and grow. They absorb sunlight, water from the soil, and carbon dioxide from  the air — and turn it all into energy.',
    ENERGY: "This energy — in the form of sugar — feeds the whole plant.  In the process, they release oxygen — the one we breathe.",
  },
  MAIN_REACTION: 'the main reaction',
  ABOUT: 'This project went from an idea and an empty Figma file to something that took shape and came to life. The layouts kept changing — I was searching for what it wanted to be. At some point, I realized: the whole process felt a lot like photosynthesis.',
  LAB: {
    TITLE: 'A Leaf Is a Lab',
    DESCRIPTION: 'Each leaf contains thousands of microscopic structures — chloroplasts. Inside them: thylakoids where photons collide with electrons. It all starts in this invisible machinery',
  },
  HOW_WORKS: {
    TITLE: 'How It Works',
    LIGHT_REACTION: 'Light Reactions',
    LIGHT_DETAILS: 'Sunlight is absorbed. Water molecules are split — oxygen is released, and energy is stored as ATP and NADPH.',
    NIGHT_REACTION: 'dark Reactions',
    NIGHT_DETAILS: 'Carbon dioxide is captured.  Using the stored energy, glucose is built — one molecule at a time.',
  },
  GREEN: {
    TITLE: 'Photosynthesis is the foundation of biological energy',
    DESCRIPTION: 'The sugar in fruit. The oxygen in your lungs.  The starting point of every ecosystem'

      {
        NAME: 'Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)',
        DESCRIPTION: 'A key ingredient for making sugars. More CO₂ (up to a point) = faster photosynthesis.',

      },
      {
        NAME: 'Temperature',
        DESCRIPTION: 'Too cold — reactions slow. Too hot — enzymes stop working. Best range: around 25°C.',
