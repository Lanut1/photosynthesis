  INTRO: {
    DEFINITION: 'Photosynthesis is how plants live and grow. They absorb\nsunlight, water from the soil, and carbon dioxide from\nthe air — and turn it all into energy.',
    ENERGY: "This energy — in the form of sugar — feeds the whole plant.\nIn the process, they release oxygen — the one we breathe.",

  ABOUT_DESKTOP: 'This project went from an idea and an empty Figma\nfile to something that took shape and came to life.\nThe layouts kept changing — I was searching for what\nit wanted to be. At some point, I realized: the whole\nprocess felt a lot like photosynthesis.',

    TITLE: 'A Leaf Is a Lab',

    TITLE: 'How It Works',
    LIGHT_REACTION: 'light reactions',
    LIGHT_DETAILS: 'Sunlight is absorbed. Water molecules\nare split — oxygen is released, and\nenergy is stored as ATP and NADPH.',

    NIGHT_DETAILS: 'Carbon dioxide is captured.\nUsing the stored energy, glucose\nis built — one molecule at a time.',
