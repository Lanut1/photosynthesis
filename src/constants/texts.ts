  INTRO: {
    DEFINITION: 'Photosynthesis is how plants live and grow. They absorb sunlight, water from the soil, and carbon dioxide from  the air — and turn it all into energy.',
    ENERGY: "This energy — in the form of sugar — feeds the whole plant.  In the process, they release oxygen — the one we breathe.",
  },
  MAIN_REACTION: 'the main reaction',
